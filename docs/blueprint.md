## Core Features:

- Homepage Design: Implement a homepage featuring a hero banner carousel, product categories, featured products, and a flash sale countdown.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a clean white or light grey for the background to give a modern feel.
- Secondary color: Use a muted grey for text and general UI elements.
- Accent: Use Teal (#008080) for key interactive elements like buttons and links, providing a balance of calmness and sophistication.
- Employ a grid-based layout for consistent spacing and alignment across all pages.
- Use a consistent set of icons from libraries like React Icons or Lucide, ensuring they are simple and easily recognizable.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and interactions to enhance the user experience without being intrusive.
